Downloader for CloudAcademy courses

I wrote this within an hour or so, therefore bugs are to be expected.

## Installation
Install on Ubuntu (Example, may vary from OS to OS):
```
$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Sign up for either a demo account or a 7-day trial. Just visiting the website alone doesn't work. Log in and save the cookie from Chrome to a file called `cookie.txt`. Open the Inspect tools and click on the "Network" tab. Refresh the page. The first item in the list will be something like `https://cloudacademy.com/`. Click on it and copy the `cookie` parameter of the request. The cookie looks a little like this:
```
clouda-session=0f0f0f0f0f0f0-0f0f-0f0f-0f0f0f0f0f0f; csrftoken=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX; sessionid=xzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxzxz; ca_jwt=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```
Paste the entire thing into `cookie.txt`. 

The script can be run either with or without the --aria2c flag. For that to work aria2c needs to be installed and added to the respective PATH variable of your system.
Then just run it like this:
```
$ python3 cloud.py
```
or
```
$ python3 cloud.py --aria2c
```
## Downloadable items
This script can download courses, learning paths or entire course libraries. Example links:
```
https://cloudacademy.com/course/amazon-aurora-high-availability/
https://cloudacademy.com/learning-paths/working-with-aws-databases-274/
https://cloudacademy.com/library/amazon-web-services/courses/
```
## Example
```
$ python3 cloud.py
Using aria2c for the downloads!
